1. Identify the protocol â†’ TCP, UDP, ICMP?
2. Follow the stream â†’ Understand full convo
3. Look at timing â†’ Is it regular? Delayed?
4. Analyze headers â†’ Any spoofing? Unusual values?
5. Decode payloads â†’ Base64? Raw files? Obfuscation?
6. Link to scenario â†’ Is this part of a scan, C2, exfil, etc.?
